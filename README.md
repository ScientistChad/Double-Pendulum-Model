# Double-Pendulum-Model

***THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE***

This is a numerical modeling example of a double pendulum using the Runge-Kutta 4th order Algorithm. For a live demo, please click [here](https://chadsdemoplatform.online).

This is a ES6 based example utilizing Jquery and FabricJS. Numerical solutions and modeling used are widely available, derivations are not including
